# About
This small project provides an up-to-date list of netblocks for selected companies to be imported into Amnezia VPN Client Split-Tunneling feature. 
Which at the end allows me not to tackle with turning VPN ON or OFF for accessing blocked resources in the country of residence.

# How-to
Just grab the latest release and download the JSON file to import into Amnezia VPN client.
Or fork the repository and add the necessary companies that you would like to pass netblocks through the tunnel. See gather.sh:3
